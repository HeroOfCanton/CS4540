					<p style="margin-top: 20px; width: 800px;">The School of Computing tracks Graduate student progress each semester to make sure the students are making satisfactory progress toward their degree. We will be implementing a system to move this manual/paper-based process into the ether, by showing some static proof of concept web pages that will (a) allow the display of a list of students, (b) allow the list of multiple progress reports per student, and (c) show the status of a student's specific progress report.</p>

					<p style="margin-top: 20px; width: 800px;">I wanted the UI choices to be simple and clean. While these first few attempts are not the most user friendly, or accessible, I think they flow well, and allow for minimal action on the part of the user to accomplish what they need to do. Design for the young, the old, and the inebriated. That is going to be the goal.</p>

					<p style="margin-top: 20px; width: 800px;">Most of my time was spent working on the student model and view. I had a dickens of a time trying to get HTML to be written with PHP calls, I'm still not sure how to do it at this point, but I know I will need to figure it out for next week, when I won't know how many people are in the database, and I need to write recursive PHP calls to get all of them written out. I also have tried getting random dates to showw up in the student forms, but as of yet, no luck on getting the code to process. Still need to troubleshoot that.</p>

					<p style="margin-top: 20px; width: 800px;">Testing strategy was simple: Use OSX, Window 7, Windows 10, and Ubuntu Linux, along with their native browsers and extra browsers, like Chrome, and Firefox, to make sure the page renders correclty.  Only Support for IE 11 and up, as Microsoft has terminated support for IE9 and 10.</p>
