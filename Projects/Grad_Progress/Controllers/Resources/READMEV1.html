					<p style="margin-top: 20px; width: 800px;">The School of Computing tracks Graduate student progress each semester to make sure the students are making satisfactory progress toward their degree. We will be implementing a system to move this manual/paper-based process into the ether, by showing some static proof of concept web pages that will (a) allow the display of a list of students, (b) allow the list of multiple progress reports per student, and (c) show the status of a student's specific progress report.</p>

					<p style="margin-top: 20px; width: 800px;">I wanted the UI choices to be simple and clean. While these first few attempts are not the most user friendly, or accessible, I think they flow well, and allow for minimal action on the part of the user to accomplish what they need to do. Design for the young, the old, and the inebriated. That is going to be the goal.</p>
					

					<p style="margin-top: 20px; width: 800px;">Nothing of note in grading. The form works, but nothing can be submitted, so don't click that button. The background should scale with browser resizing, but given that it is a 2:3 ratio image, a narrow browser will show the image behind it, as I didn't upload the full 22MP resolution image.</p>

					<p style="margin-top: 20px; width: 800px;">Testing strategy was simple: Use OSX, Window 7, Windows 10, and Ubuntu Linux, along with their native browsers and extra browsers, like Chrome, and Firefox, to make sure the page renders correclty.  Only Support for IE 11 and up, as Microsoft has terminated support for IE9 and 10.</p>
