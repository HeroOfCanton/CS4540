					<p style="margin-top: 10px; width: 800px;">The School of Computing tracks Graduate student progress each semester to make sure the students are making satisfactory progress toward their degree. We will be implementing a system to move this manual/paper-based process into the ether, by showing some static proof of concept web pages that will (a) allow the display of a list of students, (b) allow the list of multiple progress reports per student, and (c) show the status of a student's specific progress report.</p>

					<p style="margin-top: 10px; width: 800px;">I wanted the UI choices to be simple and clean. I completely redid the styling of my site, trying to avoid the image and transparent tables from last time. I might go back to some sort of image in the background, as the white looks very plain, but I think the table styling is much improved, and this feels like an improvement, especially after reorganizing the menu and structure.</p>

					<p style="margin-top: 10px; width: 800px;">Most of my time, this time, was spent working on pulling information out of the database. Once I was able to accomplish that, I needed to learn how to get PHP to write the tables I wanted depending on the amount of data; learning that took several hours. The rest of the time was spent on restyling.</p>

					<p style="margin-top: 10px; width: 800px;">Testing strategy was simple: Use OSX, Window 7, Windows 10, and Ubuntu Linux, along with their native browsers and extra browsers, like Chrome, and Firefox, to make sure the page renders correclty.  Only Support for IE 11 and up, as Microsoft has terminated support for IE9 and 10.</p>

					<p style="margin-top: 10px; width: 800px;">My Partner for the Schema design was Jordan Hendley, #34. He wasn't able to make a connection to his database, so everything is still hard coded, but he was able to redesign it so that he can drop in the database connection and query information easily. I like the flow of his site, is pretty basic UI. His main Grad Progress page will have to change once he starts querying and pulling lists of students, but that won't be too hard.</p>

					<p style="margin-top: 10px; width: 800px;">His feed back for my site was similar, in that he liked the clean layout and the simplistic design. However, he raised a good point when he brought up the need to make the 'Entrance Portal' easier to spot, he said he wasn't sure where to go when he first got into the page, and I agree with him. I'll have to revise that for the next version.</p>
